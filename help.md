# Troubleshooting

Turns out a guide this huge can cause a lot of installation problems. Who woulda thunk!!

### Help on Discord

We have an official discord channel: https://discord.gg/mV3tF65
You can come and ask for help and we can try our best to answer.

But also remember that we like to help people who are enthusiastic and not trying to get spoon-fed: [How to Ask Questions the Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

### Online Resources

There are a lot of forums available for asking help, which you can find online and we encourage you to make use of them.
If you find a bug in the guide and have found a potential fix, do come to the discord and let us know. We will try to incorporate it in the guide asap.

### Contributing to the guide

We have an official github account where we can get contribution from people
[CtGW Github](https://github.com/ctgw/wiki)

If you feel like you have something worth adding to the guide you can make an issue on github and open a pull request and we will add it to the guide asap.
Please look at the contribution guidelines on github to learn how to add things.
